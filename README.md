Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 6.2.0.

Minesweeper is a puzzle game from the 1960s about clearing mines as fast as possible using the information currently known about the proximity of mines. This is a Roblox Gui implementation done for fun.

## Getting Started

To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Minesweeper.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `Minesweeper.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```
